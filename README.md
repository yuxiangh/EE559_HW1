In this exercises, we are mainly used the KNN code to train the datasets. And the goal is to find the best K split and some basic understanding of how machine learning works.

(1). We used different metrics in KNN models like Manhattan Distance, Mahalanobis Distance,Euclidean distance. 
(2). some basic idea like confusion matrix, precision, recall, etc.
